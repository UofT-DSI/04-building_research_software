**Lesson 2 Assignment: Working In Teams**

Please work individually, but feel free to discuss with group members and refer to last week’s assignment.

**Part 1: Understanding and Implementing Project Foundations**

Tasks:

1. Code of Conduct Creation:
   1) Draft a CONDUCT.md file for a hypothetical project (you can use last assignment’s project as an example).
   1) Use the Contributor Covenant (<https://www.contributor-covenant.org/>) as a template and customize it to suit your project's needs.
   1) Include specific scenarios and how they should be handled according to the Code of Conduct.
1. Licensing Decision:
1) Choose between an MIT or GPL license for the project.
1) Create a LICENSE.md file and explain the rationale behind the choice of license.
1) Discuss how this license will impact contributions and usage of the project.

**Part 2: Practical Application and Workflow Management**

Tasks:

1. Issue Tracking and Management:
1) Create a list of 5 hypothetical issues (bug reports, feature requests, discussions) that might arise in your project.
1) Categorize these issues using labels such as "Bug", "Enhancement", "Task", "Question", and others mentioned in the chapter.
1) For each issue, outline a brief action plan or resolution strategy.

**Part 3: Conflict Resolution and Team Dynamics**

1\.

1) Analyze this situation:

“Alex, the lead software developer, had delegated specific tasks to team members with clear deadlines. Jordan, a new team member with expertise in data visualization, was responsible for integrating a complex graphing module into the software. Sam, an experienced data scientist, was supposed to review and validate the data algorithms before integration. As the deadline approached, Alex discovered that the graphing module developed by Jordan was incompatible with the existing software architecture. Jordan, being new and eager to impress, had innovated without consulting the team, leading to a module that, while advanced, did not align with the project’s technical framework.

Simultaneously, Sam, overwhelmed with their own research work, had only cursorily reviewed the data algorithms and missed several critical errors. These errors would potentially lead to inaccurate data interpretations, a serious issue for the credibility of the research. With the deadline missed, the project sponsor expressed disappointment, and tensions rose within the team. Team members began pointing fingers, with some criticizing Jordan for not following established protocols and others blaming Sam for not fulfilling their review responsibilities. Alex felt responsible but was frustrated with the lack of communication and oversight.”

2) Propose a step-by-step strategy for addressing and resolving the conflict.
2) Reflect on the potential impact of unresolved conflicts on a project.
2. Team Member Profile Response:
1) Review the following team member profiles (from: <https://merely-useful.tech/py-rse/teams.html#teams-ex-invisible>) :
- *Anna* thinks she knows more about every subject than everyone else on the team put together. No matter what you say, she’ll correct you; no matter what you know, she knows better. If you keep track in team meetings of how often people interrupt one another, her score is usually higher than everyone else’s put together.
- *Bao* is a contrarian: no matter what anyone says, he’ll take the opposite side. This is healthy in small doses, but when Bao does it, there’s always another objection lurking behind the first half dozen.
- *Frank* believes that knowledge is power. He enjoys knowing things that other people don’t—or to be more accurate, he enjoys it when people know he knows things they don’t. Frank can actually make things work, but when asked how he did it, he’ll grin and say, “Oh, I’m sure you can figure it out.”
- *Hediyeh* is quiet. Very quiet. She never speaks up in meetings, even when she knows that what other people are saying is wrong. She might contribute to the mailing list, but she’s very sensitive to criticism, and will always back down rather than defending her point of view.
- *Kenny* is a hitchhiker. He has discovered that most people would rather shoulder some extra work than snitch, and he takes advantage of it at every turn. The frustrating thing is that he’s so damn *plausible* when someone finally does confront him. “There have been mistakes on all sides,” he says, or, “Well, I think you’re nit-picking.”
- *Melissa* would easily have made the varsity procrastination team if she’d bothered to show up to tryouts. She means well—she really does feel bad about letting people down—but somehow her tasks are never finished until the last possible moment. Of course, that means that everyone who is depending on her can’t do their work until *after* the last possible moment.
- *Petra*’s favorite phrase is “why don’t we.” Why don’t we write a GUI to help people edit the program’s configuration files? Hey, why don’t we invent our own little language for designing GUIs?
- *Raj* is rude. “It’s just the way I talk,” he says. “If you can’t hack it, maybe you should find another team.” His favorite phrase is, “That’s stupid,” and he uses obscenity in every second sentence.
2) Choose three profiles, suggest strategies for effectively working with and integrating these individuals into the team.
2) Compare your discussion with your group members.
