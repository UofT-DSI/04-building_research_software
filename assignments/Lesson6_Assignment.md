**Lesson 6: Handling Errors Assignment**

Choose one of your existing Python programs (from this course or otherwise) and add improvements to its error handling:

1. Identify at least one place in your code where an exception could occur that is not currently caught with try/except. Add an appropriate try/except block to catch the exception and display an informative error message for the user.
1. Improve the error messages in your except blocks to follow the guidelines from the slide “Writing Useful Error Messages” on being specific, avoiding blame, etc. Put the error messages in a separate ERRORS dictionary.
1. Add logging calls using Python's logging module so you can control the level of debugging info displayed. Configure logging to write debug messages to a file while also printing warnings and above.

Document your improvements with comments and submit the link to your GitHub repository. Explain in a short report how your changes improve error handling and the user experience, and discuss any remaining weaknesses in your program's error handling.
