# Building Robust Software Homework 4

## Task 1
1. Using the Python `requests` library, retrieve some data from an online API
    * Refer to the list of suggested APIs at the bottom of the BRS Assignment
    * Or select your own online
1. Parse the response you've received from the API

### Optional exercise
Does the API have a list function?
    * If so, try retrieving a list of objects (eg. list Pokemon with specific abilities)
    * Loop over the list of objects and use the API to retrieve additional details

For example:
    * Loop over Pokemon with a specific ability
    * Put the list into a DataFrame with column for the Pokemon name, HP, attack, and defense stats
    * For each Pokemon in the list, use the API to retrieve the Pokemon details and store into the respective columns

## Task 2
1. Using the Python `requests` library, use an online API to do something
    * Consider ntfy.sh or the [Spotify Player API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/start-a-users-playback)
