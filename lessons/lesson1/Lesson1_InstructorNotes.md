**Lesson 1 Instructor Notes**

This lesson involves code-along sessions to introduce students to branches and pull requests.

Since this is the first lesson, the code along, which starts on **slide 7**, should start with the instructor creating a GitHub repository while sharing their screen. The instructor should walk students through the process of cloning a repository, at which point they can create a branch to contribute a small change (for instance, adding their name to the read me under a “Contributors” subheading). There is another

The code-along in **slide 18-19** would use the same instructor repository, except with a focus on forking.

Notes on slides:

\- **Slide 3-4**: “fit” is used as a branch name in the textbook. It refers to changes made to write code for fitting a model. The textbook suggests choosing branch names that are informative in some way, so you could mention that for context in this example.
