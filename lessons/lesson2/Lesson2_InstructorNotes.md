**Lesson 2 Instructor Notes**

The slides for this lesson are primarily non-technical and informative, so that students can refer back to them during the assignment. The beginning of class can start with a question like “What kind of projects can go in a repo?” to facilitate discussion and contextualize the rest of the class. There is no code-along, although at **slide 7**, the instructor can show students where the license options are located in GitHub, and at **slide 14**, the instructor can guide students in where to create a GitHub issue.
