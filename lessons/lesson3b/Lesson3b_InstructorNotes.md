> **Lesson 3b: Instructor Notes**
>
> These slides rely pretty heavily on the example project in the
> textbook. The goal is for students to understand the general idea of
> virtual environments, Python Package Index (PyPI), Distributing and
> Documenting packages. There is no code along. The assignment is a
> question and answer based worksheet, and the instructor should suggest
> that if students want to develop a package of their own, reading
> Chapter 14\
> () is an excellent resource.
