## Description:
Much work these days is done using software. Analysts need to develop a comfort with building, maintaining, and improving high-quality software, even if they are not primarily employed as a software engineer or developer. This course focuses on equipping students with the skills to build robust software that can be used to answer questions. It focuses on how to effectively write short programs, as part of a small team, in a reproducible way. Software that is built correctly can be used by other teams, not just the person who originally wrote it.

## Learning Outcomes
Students will know how to:
1. Learn how to work as a team within a Git/GitHub setting. Specifically, branching, merging, conflicts, and pull requests.
2. Know how to create bug reports and prioritize requests.
3. Develop a comfort with using makefiles and configuring programs.
4. Proficiently test software, handle errors, and track provenance
5. Know how to create Python packages.
6. Acquire a comfort with calling APIs. 
7. Develop comfort with Docker

### Delivery instructions
The workshop will be held over three weeks, three days a week. Two of the three days will be 2-hours long and the last day will be 3-hours. Being mindful of online fatigue, there will be one break during each class where students are encouraged to stretch, grab a drink and snacks, or ask any additional questions.

### Technology Requirements
1. Camera is optional although highly encouraged. We understand that not everyone may have the space at home to have the camera on.

## Policies
The course is a live-coding class. Students are expected to follow along with the coding, creating files and folders to navigate and manipulate. Students should be active participants while coding and are encouraged to ask questions throughout. Although slides will be available for students to reference, they should be referenced before or after class, as during class will be dedicated to coding with the instructor.

**How to submit assignments, late policy, academic integrity.**

## Folder Structure
Below are the folders contained in this repo with a description of what they contain and information on how to use them.

### 1 *assignments*:
This folder contains the assignments for the workshop. Students are expected to complete them one week after the content has been delivered.

### 2. *lessons*:
This folder contains the pdf and html version of the slides. Either the pdf slides or the html slides can be used when teaching. If slides are edited to contain any gifs, the instructor will need to use the html slides so that the gifs are active.

pdf slides should be referenced before class to prepare or after class to review. During class will be live-coding, therefore, there is no need to follow them during class. They contain all information that was discussed in class and are a great resource in the future if students need to reassess their knowledge.
